  I currently work as an eDiscovery Analyst at <a href="https://swiss-fts.com/">Swiss FTS</a> and will soon finish my Masters in Computer Science.<br/><br/>
  The motivation behind nearly all of my projects comes from curiosity and the desire to solve problems, e.g., <br/>
      When I was an undergraduate student on a budget, doing an internship in Switzerland, I created <a href="https://github.com/danielj0nes/priisvergliich">Priisvergliich</a>.<br/>
           To try and improve my productivity and take more breaks in the most effective way possible, I made <a href="https://github.com/danielj0nes/breakbuddy">BreakBuddy</a>.<br/>
         ...And to play board games with a slight <i>advantage</i>, I made <a href="https://github.com/danielj0nes/bga-helper">BGA Helper</a> ;-).                                                       <br/><br/>
  I'm always open to collaboration, whether formal or informal, so feel free to reach out!
