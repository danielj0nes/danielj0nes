  I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://farsight.net/">Farsight</a> and have a master's degree in Computer Science.<br/><br/>
  The motivation behind nearly all of my projects comes from curiosity and the desire to solve problems, e.g., <br/>
  • When I was an undergraduate student on a budget, doing an internship in Switzerland, I created <a href="https://github.com/danielj0nes/priisvergliich">Priisvergliich</a>.<br/>
  • To try and improve my productivity and take more breaks in the most effective way possible, I made <a href="https://github.com/danielj0nes/breakbuddy">BreakBuddy</a>.<br/>
  • ...And to play board games with a slight <i>advantage</i>, I made <a href="https://github.com/danielj0nes/bga-helper">BGA Helper</a> ;-).<br/><br/>
  I'm always open to collaborate, whether formal or informal; so don't hesitate to get in touch!
